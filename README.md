# (Ford Go Bike Data Exploration)
## by (Bankole Ridwan Abiola)


## Dataset

The dataset consisted of record for about 183,412 trips and 16 features 
including trip durations (seconds), user information and station information. 
197 of the record had no information about station, 8265 had no users 
information and 16 out of them did not have both.


## Summary of Findings


In the exploration, I found out that: trip duration is unimodal with most 
of the trips took less than 1000 seconds, 70% of the users were male, and 
users travelled longer trip durations per day in the weekend than weekday. 
Furthermore, it was not surprising that most of the trips occur between 
7:00am and 9:00am which was when users tend to go to work and between 
4:00pm and 7:00pm which was when they tend to close from work; it could 
imply frequent use of bike to avoid traffic during the rush hours.
When I considered the influence of users' age on the trip durations, 
I observed that trip durations greater than 60,000 seconds were covered 
by users between age 20 and 30; also, no user younger than 20 years or 
older than 60 years ever travelled a duration higher than 10,000 seconds.
Though fewer customers rode per day than subscriber but customer rode for 
a longer duration per day than subscriber. Also, average duration per 
day remained fairly constant throughout the week for subscriber, this could 
mean subscribers were limited to a fixed trip duration base on what they 
subscribed for; but customers rode for a very long duration according to their 
need at the moment.

Outside the main feature of interest, I observed a similar trend in trip 
duration against age for both male and female. However, male distribution 
tinted slightly to higher age than female and there were more male users older 
than 60 years than male users. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

In the exploration when I considered the influence of users' age on the trip durations, 
I found that trip durations greater than 60,000 seconds were covered 
by users between age 20 and 30; also, no user younger than 20 years or 
older than 60 years ever travelled a duration higher than 10,000 seconds.

Also I found fewer customers rode per day than subscriber but customer rode for 
a longer duration per day than subscriber. Also, average duration per 
day remained fairly constant throughout the week for subscriber, this could 
mean subscribers were limited to a fixed trip durations as they might have
chosen in their subscription; but customers could ride for as long as their 
need was at the moment.
